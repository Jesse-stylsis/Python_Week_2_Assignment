# Python_Week_2_Assignment
# Python List Manipulation

This project demonstrates basic list operations in Python. The program performs a series of operations on a list, such as appending elements, inserting values, extending with another list, removing an element, sorting, and finding the index of a specific value.

## Operations Performed:
1. **Create an empty list**: The list is initialized as an empty list.
2. **Append elements**: The elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` are added to the list using the `append()` method.
3. **Insert a value**: The value `15` is inserted at the second position in the list using the `insert()` method.
4. **Extend the list**: The list is extended by adding another list `[50, 60, 70]` using the `extend()` method.
5. **Remove the last element**: The last element is removed from the list using the `pop()` method.
6. **Sort the list**: The list is sorted in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
7. **Find the index of a value**: The program finds and prints the index of the value `30` in the list.

## Installation

No installation is required. You can simply run the script using Python 3.12.

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python list_operations.py
